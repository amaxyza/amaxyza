  I’m currently working on [Lexiconnect](https://github.com/Lexiconnectt/Lexiconnect), [Shutterbirds](https://plasmamintz.itch.io/shutterbirds), and reading more software engineering literature! <br>

  If you have any suggestions for software-related books (particularly in the backend or graphics world), please email me your recommendations [here](mailto:email@anthonyestevez.dev)!
